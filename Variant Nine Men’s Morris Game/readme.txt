• Used the Game Tree concept in a variant Nine Men’s Morris Game to predict the best move in each turn

• Implemented the Minimax Algorithm in Java to dynamically evaluate a board position in the game

• Improved the efficiency of program by replacing the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm
