The Morris Game Variant is a variant of Nine Men's Morris game. Each player has 9 pieces, and the game
board is as shown above. Pieces can be placed on intersections of lines. (There are a total of 22 locations
for pieces.) The goal is to remove opponent's pieces by getting three pieces on a single line (a mill). The
winner is the rst player to reduce the opponent to only 2 pieces, or block the opponent from any further
moves. The game has three distinct phases: opening, midgame, and endgame.

Opening: Players take turns placing 9 pieces - one at a time - on any vacant board intersection spot.

Midgame: Players take turns moving one piece along a board line to any adjacent vacant spot.

Endgame: A player down to only three pieces may move a piece to any open spot, not just an adjacent one (hopping).

Mills: At any stage if a player gets three of their pieces on the same straight board line (a mill), then one 
of the opponent's isolated pieces is removed from the board. An isolated piece is a piece that is not part of
a mill.
